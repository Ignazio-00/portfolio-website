## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio website commit"
```

2. **Create GitHub repository**:

   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name it "portfolio-website" or "my-portfolio"
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have code)

3. **Connect and push**:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)**
2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub
3. **Import Project**:

   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Framework will auto-detect as "Create React App"

4. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `build`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

In Vercel project settings:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add these three variables:

```
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID = your_service_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID = your_template_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY = your_public_key
```

⚠️ **Important**: Use the same values from your local `.env` file

### Step 4: Deploy

1. Click **Deploy**
2. Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. Your site will be live at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### ✅ Already Implemented
